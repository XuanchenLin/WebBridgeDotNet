## WebBridge.NET

### 🚀 About

This is an open-source .NET library designed to bridge the gap between web applications and the native operating system. You can expose custom APIs in the browser's JavaScript context, allowing web pages to directly and asynchronously interact with local system resources.

Modern web applications are confined to the browser's sandbox. WebBridge provides a controlled pathway through these walls by establishing a communication channel from the browser to a .NET backend running locally. By binding your .NET code to the JavaScript environment, you can grant web apps the ability to leverage the full power of the underlying OS.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Call Native APIs:** Execute local .NET code directly from JavaScript functions
- **Launch & Manage Applications:** Start, monitor, and interact with desktop applications from a web UI.
- **Interact with Peripheral Devices:** Read from scanners, sensors, or other custom hardware.
- **Full-Stack Integration:** Seamlessly integrate rich web frontends with powerful .NET backend logic.

### 🖥️ Requirements

**Development Environment:**

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8.0 or higher

**Supported Platforms:**

- Windows / macOS / Linux
- Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
